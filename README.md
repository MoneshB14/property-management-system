# 🏠 Property Management System

A Spring Boot-based backend system for managing real estate properties. This application follows the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern and uses **MongoDB** for storage, including an event store. It features secure manager authentication using **AES encryption**, proper validation, and RESTful APIs for all key operations.

- 🔐 Secure password encryption using AES
- 🧮 Calculate manager salary (10% of total rental income)
- 🧠 Query-based endpoints:
  - Get all properties
  - Get only occupied properties
  - Filter properties by area
  - Find property with the lowest value
- 🧾 Event sourcing for tracking key actions
- 🧱 Uses CQRS for clean command-query separation
- 📦 MongoDB for data + event storage

🔐 Manager Authentication
Passwords are encrypted before storage and decrypted for validation using AES. The secret key and algorithm details are stored in application.yml as environment variables.
